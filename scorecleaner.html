                    At present, in my free time I am building an application that aimed at solving a "review bombing" problem. 
                    Some groups of people massively leave negative user reviews for a published work, for example, video game or film, to harm 
                    its sales and popularity. This is often done to draw wider attention to political or cultural 
                    issues around the product or its vendor. Unfortunately, online media review aggregates do not 
                    have any mechanisms to prevent or regulate this occurrence. This application extracts user 
                    reviews from Metacritic for a given product and then processes these data, analyses it, and 
                    detects "angry" reviews. In the end, it shows average user score free from "review bombing", 
                    a list of adequate reviews and additional statistics with visualization which Metacritic does 
                    not provide. Although this application works now, I believe that in future it can be significantly 
                    improved, for example, by using natural language processing for more precise recognition and 
                    analysis of "angry reviews" and defining the origin and the nature of the phenomenon in a particular case.
